# google-font-cacher
Downloads a local cache of Google Fonts with NodeJS

Usage example:
```
nodejs gfontget.js "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans"
```

Example output:

```input/Open+Sans.css``` The original CSS file

```output/Open-Sans-latin.truetype``` The font for latin-based charsets

```output/index.htm``` A basic HTML file for taking a look at Open-Sans-latin.truetype

This is in no way associated with nor endorsed by Google. It's just a NodeJS script some guy made.
